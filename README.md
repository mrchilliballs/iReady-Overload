# iReady-Overload-Reborn
This is an archive of the first iReady Overload made by [ArjhanToteck](https://github.com/ArjhanToteck).

This doesn't work for years now. Don't even try using it.

Original Repo Description: iReady is awful. It's the worst education tool anyone could ever use. This code is designed to skip through iReady lessons and quizzes.
